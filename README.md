## How I do this:

In the header i created burger menu, added YouTube logo, searching string with special styles and added "create" "apps" "notification" buttons, also i added user profile & button "more" which open visible on the mobile (adaptiv mode)
4. Then i created branch "add-main" from "dev" branch in which i added CSS style for the main. In the "main" i added VIDEO (like YouTube watching) and components for this: "show more" (adaptiv mode), "pause" "next video" "mute" "subtitles" "settings" "theater mode" "full screen" "likes" "dislikes" "share" buttons & added "more" button which visible on the desktop. Added some YOUTUBE video components: name of the channel, count of subscribs, button "subscribe" with count of subscribers, discription of the video and date of publication. Also added on the right side sidebar with video's 
5. Then i created branch "add-sidebar" from "dev" branch in which i added CSS style for the sidebar. In the "sidebar" i created tool for the mobile version of YouTube Redesign Concept in which i added buttons "home" "trending" "subscriptions" "library". And made 'nice' look for the mobile version
